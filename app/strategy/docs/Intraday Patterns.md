# Intraday Patterns — What Causes Them

|Pattern|Price Swing (recap)|Causes / Microstructure Drivers (the “why”)|
|---|---|---|
|**1) Morning Spike → Midday Fade** (“pump-and-fade”)|Big pop 9:30–10:30, then grind lower|**Opening auction imbalances** + **overnight info gap** create forced buying at the bell; **retail/momo chase** + **news algos** push higher. As liquidity normalizes, **VWAP algos** and **profit-taking** lean against stretched price; **supply from trapped late buyers** and **short sellers** pressing into lower highs cause the fade. In small/low-float names: **promotional flow**, **halts**, and **thin books** exaggerate reversals.|
|**2) Morning Surge → All-Day Uptrend** (“trend-up day”)|Up early, holds VWAP, closes strong|**Real money demand** (funds re-rating after earnings/catalyst), **positive index/sector flows**, **passive/ETF inflows**, and **CTA/systematic trend** reinforcement. **Dealer hedging** (options **short gamma**) can **force buy-to-hedge** on strength. Shallow pullbacks are absorbed by **VWAP execution** and **buy-the-dip algos**; **late-day MOC buy imbalances** keep a bid.|
|**3) Morning Plunge → Midday Recovery** (intraday reversal up)|Down hard at open, bases, then climbs|**Opening stop-runs/liquidity sweep** flush weak hands; **news overreaction** + **value buyers** step in at key HTF levels; **RSI/MACD divergence** aligns with **short-covering** once price reclaims **VWAP**. If indices stabilize, **beta tailwinds** help. Dealers **long gamma** can dampen downside and **mean-revert** price toward the center.|
|**4) Morning Sell-off → All-Day Downtrend** (“trend-down day”)|Down early, below VWAP all day|**Distribution by institutions** (downgrades, guide-downs, sector de-risking), **ETF/pair-trade outflows**, **negative macro (rates, USD, oil)**. **Dealer short-vol positioning** can flip to **sell-to-hedge** (short gamma) on drops. **Failed VWAP retests** invite momentum shorts; **MOC sell programs** and **index rebalances** extend weakness into the close.|
|**5) Choppy / Range-Bound** (sideways/whipsaw)|Range after morning, fakeouts|**Order-book equilibrium**: two-sided flow, **low net information**. **Lunch-hour liquidity drop** widens spreads and reduces follow-through; **market makers inventory-manage** around VWAP. **Low ADX regime**, **options pinning** (max pain) near popular strikes, and **event-waiting** (Fed/earnings) suppress trend until a new catalyst hits.|

# Multi-Day Patterns — What Causes Them

|Pattern|Multi-Day Behavior (recap)|Causes / Microstructure Drivers (the “why”)|
|---|---|---|
|**A) Sustained Uptrend** (multi-day rally)|Higher highs/lows for days–weeks|**Earnings re-rating**, **estimate revisions**, **theme/AI/sector leadership**, **fund inflows** (mutual, passive, CTA). **Short interest bleed-off** provides fuel; **upside earnings surprises**, **new product/regulatory wins**. **Dealer short gamma** + **call buying** → hedging **chase up**; **relative strength** attracts more capital.|
|**B) Sustained Downtrend** (multi-day selloff)|Lower highs/lows for days–weeks|**Guidance cuts**, **structural headwinds**, **debt/credit stress**, **factor rotations** (out of small/Value/EM), **redemptions** from funds. **Put buying** + dealers **sell-to-hedge**; **downgrades**, **lawsuits**, **pipeline failures** (biotech). **Macro tightening** (rates/FX) and **risk-off** regimes keep rallies fleeting.|
|**C) Uptrend → Reversal Down** (“blow-off / first red day”)|Parabolic pop, then sharp turn|**Exhaustion of marginal buyers** after **climactic volume**; **insider/VC unlocks**, **profit-taking by funds**, **disappointing guidance/CC tone** after the spike. **Bearish divergence**, **gap-and-fail**, and **dealer gamma flip** (from short to long) reduce forced buying, enabling **air-pocket** drops.|
|**D) Downtrend → Reversal Up** (trend change bottom)|Capitulation low, multi-day bounce|**Capitulation** (forced liquidations, margin calls), **value/insider buybacks**, **catalyst relief** (FDA resubmission, settlement, asset sale), **positioning asymmetry** (crowded shorts) → **squeeze**. **Bullish divergence**, **base/neckline breaks**, **put decay** and dealer **long gamma** stabilize price.|
|**E) Sideways Consolidation / Base**|Multi-day/-week range|**Information vacuum**; **balanced flows** between fundamental buyers/sellers. **Volatility compression** (Bollinger squeeze), **options pinning**, **awaiting catalyst** (earnings, guidance, Fed). **Program/VWAP execution** recycles liquidity; eventual **volume expansion** + **breakout** when new info resolves uncertainty.|

# Stock-Type Modifiers (why the same pattern behaves differently)

- **Penny / Micro-cap:** **Low float**, **thin books**, **promotion/discord pumps**, and **halt mechanics** create outsized gaps and **one-and-done** morning spikes; fades are common as **borrow appears** and promoters stop bidding. Settlement/locate frictions amplify moves.
    
- **Large-cap / Mega-cap:** **Deep liquidity**, **index membership**, and **institutional VWAP execution** smooth trends; patterns rely more on **macro/factor** flows (rates, dollar, sector rotations) and **options gamma** around big strikes (e.g., 200/250).
    
- **High-Volatility Movers:** **Fresh catalysts** (earnings, M&A, FDA, guidance) + **social amplification** → **gap + continuation** _or_ **gap + fade** depending on **surprise quality**, **positioning**, and **how far from VWAP** the open prints.
    
- **Low-Vol / Defensives:** **Income mandates**, **low beta**, and **stable ownership** mute patterns; breakouts need **earnings beats** or **rate shifts** to transition from range to trend.
    

# Indicator-to-Cause Map (what the signals often _mean_ under the hood)

- **VWAP reclaim/loss:** Institutional **execution pivot**—above VWAP = net demand/accumulation; below = net supply/distribution. Fails at VWAP often mean **supply wall** from sellers targeting benchmark exits.
    
- **RSI extremes + divergence:** Crowd **exhaustion** (buyers running out of fuel on new highs; sellers tiring on new lows). Divergences often precede **dealer hedging flips** and **flow inflection**.
    
- **MACD crossovers / zero-line turns:** Momentum regime change as **trend followers** and **systematic overlays** flip bias; good confirmation for swing inflections.
    
- **Bollinger squeezes/expansions:** **Liquidity compression** → **information shock** → range expansion; direction is set by **surprise vs. expectation** and **who is offsides**.
    
- **OBV/volume surge:** **Information arrival** (news) or **inventory transfer** from weak to strong hands (or vice versa). Breakouts without volume lack institutional sponsorship.
    

# Practical: How to Use the Causes

- **Plan by catalyst clock:** Heaviest _exogenous_ shocks: **8:30a** econ data, **10:00a** reports, **2:00p** Fed/minutes, **post-close** earnings. Expect **trend starts**, **reversals**, or **range breaks** around these.
    
- **Watch options positioning:** Large OI strikes and **gamma** can **pin** price (range days) or **amplify** trends (short-gamma chases). Into OPEX or big earnings weeks, expect **power-hour** volatility.
    
- **Respect liquidity regime:** Open/close = **impactful flow**; lunch = **maker-dominated** whipsaw. Trend tactics in high-liquidity windows; mean-reversion inside low-liquidity ranges.
