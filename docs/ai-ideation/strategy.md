# Strategy Playbook

## Core Concepts
The system classifies stocks into **patterns**, then assigns them into **capital buckets** for intraday execution.

### Intraday Patterns (from research)
- **Morning Spike → Fade (Pump & Fade)**
- **Morning Surge → All-Day Uptrend (Trend-Up)**
- **Morning Plunge → Midday Recovery**
- **Morning Sell-Off → All-Day Downtrend**
- **Choppy/Range-Bound Day**

### Multi-Day Patterns
- **Sustained Uptrend (Multi-Day Rally)**
- **Sustained Downtrend (Multi-Day Selloff)**
- **Blow-Off Top / First Red Day**
- **Downtrend → Reversal Up**
- **Sideways Consolidation/Base**

### Capital Buckets
- **Bucket A (20%)** – Penny stocks & microcap movers.
- **Bucket B (30%)** – Large-cap intraday trends.
- **Bucket C (20%)** – Multi-day swings.
- **Bucket D (20%)** – Catalyst-driven high-volatility stocks.
- **Bucket E (10%)** – Stable low-volatility hedge (dividends, ETFs).

### Time Slots
- **9:30–10:30 AM (Open)**: momentum spikes, high volatility.
- **10:30–1:30 (Midday)**: range-bound, dip buys, mean reversion.
- **1:30–3:00 (Afternoon)**: reversal opportunities, trend continuation.
- **3:00–4:00 (Power Hour)**: volatility surge, institutional rebalancing.

## Mapping Strategy
- Stocks → Patterns → Buckets → Entry/Exit Playbook
- Example:
  - **Small-cap spike @ 9:45** → Bucket A → Short fade after VWAP break.
  - **Large-cap uptrend day** → Bucket B → Buy pullbacks near VWAP/20EMA.
  - **Market mover (earnings gap)** → Bucket D → Gap-and-go or gap-fill.
